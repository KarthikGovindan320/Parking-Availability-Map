# Parking-Availability-Map

## Overview
Parking is one of the major downsides of living in a big city.  
Finding **legal parking** spots, especially around crowded areas like shopping malls, can be a real challenge.

Sometimes, we wish there were a **Google Maps-style** service that shows available parking spots — maybe even lets us **book them in advance**.  
So, instead of wishing... why not build it?

## What This Project Does
I developed a **map-integrated website** to solve this very problem.  
The platform allows users to:
- View **available parking spots** nearby.
- **Book parking** in advance (available for a selected number of spots).
- **Track booking history** and parking expenses.
- Use a **credit-based system** for seamless payments.

The idea is to create a smooth, secure, and user-friendly parking solution — somewhat like FAST-Tag, but **without direct bank access**, making it feel more secure.

## Features
- 🗺️ **Live Map Integration**  
  Shows nearby available parking spots with real-time updates.

- 🕒 **Advanced Booking System**  
  Users can reserve specific parking spots ahead of time (limited selection).

- 💳 **Credit System**  
  - Buy credits in advance.
  - Use credits automatically when booking.
  - Avoid the hassle of making on-the-spot payments.

- 📧 **Email Integration**  
  - OTPs for login
  - Notifications for bookings
  - Alerts for credit usage and account updates

- 📚 **Booking History**  
  Keeps a detailed log of all bookings and expenses.

## Future Goals
